This script generates PDF reports from data in Pandas DataFrames using jinja and pdfkit.
A client needed (very) simple documents recording the content of a survey but needed it for
~50 items so I made this to get the job done relatively quickly. This code will work if
all content is downloaded and unzipped into a single directory (with images in a folder).
